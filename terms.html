                            <p>Welcome to Alternic, owned and operated by Alternic Inc. (“Alternic,” “we,” “us”, or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Alternic website(s), our APIs, mobile applications (“App”), and any live support, software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with our services (collectively, the “Service”). This includes using our services to view, explore, help display and create NFTs, and using our tools to connect directly with others to mint, purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public blockchains. “NFT” means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.</p>
                            <p>“You” means you as the user of the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity, “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms.</p>
                            <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong> BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT, SIGNING, AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.</p>
                            <p>Alternic is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor, money services business, or creditor. Alternic provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users discover and directly interact with each other and NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not have custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.</p>
                            <p>Alternic is not party to any agreement between any users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers using the Service and we make no claims, guarantees, or recommendations about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or NFTs (and any content associated with such NFTs) visible on the Service.</p>
                            <p>Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services (and such services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service.</p>
                            <p>Alternic reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.</p>

                            <h2 id="accessing-the-service">Accessing the Service</h2>
                            <p>Your blockchain address functions as your identity on Alternic. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address and a third-party wallet to access the Service. Your account on the Service (“Account”) will be associated with your blockchain address; however, if you want to add some flair to your Alternic persona, you can add additional information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.</p>
                            <p>Your Account on Alternic will be associated with your linked blockchain address and display the NFTs for that blockchain address (and, if applicable, any content associated with such NFTs). By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Alternic, and Alternic does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Alternic accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider.</p>
                            <p>You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws in connection with using the Service. In order to comply with our legal obligations and keep our users and platform safe, we may need to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the Service. You acknowledge that Alternic is under no obligation to disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you.</p>
                            <p>Alternic may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, to provide you with a requested service, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, Alternic, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account and block your ability to access the Service until such additional information and documents are processed by Alternic. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a request, Alternic may refuse to restore your access to the Service.</p>
                            <p>Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time for several reasons, including maintenance, updates, equipment malfunction, or other actions that Alternic may elect to take. We require all users to be at least 18 years old. If you are at least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may only use Alternic through a parent or guardian’s Account.</p>

                            <h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
                            <p>The Service, including its “look and feel” (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos, page headers, button icons, URLs, and scripts), proprietary content and other materials are the property of Alternic or our affiliates, licensors, or users. All rights are reserved.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>If you misuse materials, your right to access the Service will stop immediately and you may be required to destroy or return copies.</p>
                            <p>We welcome feedback (“Feedback”). You agree Alternic may use Feedback for any purpose without compensation and you assign all related rights to Alternic.</p>

                            <h2 id="license">License to Access and Use Our Service and Content</h2>
                            <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, personal license to access and use the Service subject to compliance with these Terms.</p>

                            <h2 id="third-party-content">Third-Party Content, Agreements, and Services</h2>
                            <p>Alternic helps you explore NFTs created by third parties. We do not guarantee the authenticity, legality, or availability of NFTs. You are responsible for verifying third-party content. Terms attached to NFTs (“NFT Terms”) are set by buyers, sellers, or creators and not by Alternic.</p>
                            <p>Sellers determine NFT pricing and any applicable taxes. Alternic may receive fees for its Service but does not control gas or transaction fees and cannot refund them.</p>
                            <p>The Service may link to third-party websites or applications (“Third-Party Websites/Applications”). Such resources are not under Alternic’s control and are used at your own risk.</p>
                            <p>The Service may rely on access to ICANN registered domains; availability is not guaranteed.</p>

                            <h2 id="user-conduct">User Conduct</h2>
                            <p>We may take action if we believe you have violated these Terms. You agree you will not:</p>
